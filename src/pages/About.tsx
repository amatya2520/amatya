              In the heart of rural India, where the rhythm of life still beats to the hum of nature and the wisdom of age-old traditions, a quiet revolution was born — Amatya.

              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                The journey began with a simple yet powerful vision: <strong>To bring the purity of the village to every urban kitchen.</strong>
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                For generations, our families nurtured cows with care. These were not just products — they were symbols of a lifestyle rooted in wellness, honesty, and sustainability.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                As cities grow and markets changed, we saw the soul of food being lost to mass production. That's when we decided to bridge the gap — fusing the authenticity of farm life with the needs of the modern world. Thus, Amatya was born.
